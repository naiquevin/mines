Mines
=====

What?
-----

Minesweeper written in Javascript using Jquery.


Important Notes
---------------

- This code was written by me around 2.5 years ago
  (2009-2010) with enthusiasm of a jquery fanboy.
  I enjoyed and learnt a lot while writing this.

- Mines is hosted here but will be taken down. The reason why I am
  adding the code to github.

- Most of the code is the same although I have added
  some text like the one you are reading now and fixed whitespace.

- I don't write code as horrible as this one any longer ;-)

- Right now, I am not really interested in rewriting it, but may be
  sometime later, as an exercise for comparing SLOC and
  efficiency. OTOH, if anyone is interested, they are free to do so.
